            <h2>Welcom to Babylist</h2>
            <p>We created Babylist with one key goal: to build a better baby registry experience that truly puts parents first. In 2011, I was pregnant with my first son and ready to create a registry. As a former software engineer at Amazon, I expected to ease and simplicity. What I found was the opposite. My choices were to stick with a single retailer or manage multiple registries. I spent hours researching products without confidence I was making the right decisions. And I couldn’t register for services I wanted, like frozen meals, pet-sitting or diaper delivery. I knew there had to be a better way. So, I got to work. Babylist launched two weeks before my first son, Max was born. What began as a side-project has become a leading brand for new parents: one in two first-time parents creates a Babylist registry and millions of families turn to us for practical support and data-driven guidance every month. I’m now a mom of two and more committed to our vision than ever</p>
